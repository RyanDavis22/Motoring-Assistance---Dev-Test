# Motoring-Assistance---Dev-Test
A quick demo of using VueJS to search through the NASA image API and display the results.

Given the short notice for this test I focused on geting the main functionality working, as such it may not look especially pretty and I was not able to finish off any of the extra taskes mentioned in the briefing (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lr9rYMehPmpr5AJRRSF6pQy6jIOGf35i3Q3KTQG6oa8/edit?usp=sharing).

However my next steps would be: to add in an option to search for audio/videos, I would achieve this by adding a dropdown next to the search box to select the type of media to search for image/audio/video then pass that value to the searchNasa function as a second variable and then use that to set the media_type component of the API query. I would then add the option to scroll thorugh multiple pages of results, via buttons at the bottom of the page, by first changing which slice of the api response I am looking at and then by increasing the value of the page component of the API query, whilst accounting for the total_hits returned by the API query metadata to ensure I don't have too many pages. I could then look into making a display popup for each result using all of the returned data to display any more relavent information to the user like the image description and title. Finally once that is completed I could then try making everything look a little less basic.
